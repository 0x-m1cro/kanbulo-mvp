# Product Copy Template — "Why it matters"

- **Softness**: Describe how the textile feels in sensory language (e.g., "buttery, aloe-rinsed organic cotton that calms delicate skin").
- **Care**: Explain why the construction or maintenance respects the wearer (e.g., "nickel-free closures, reinforced seams that stay smooth after washing").
- **Ethical Production**: Reaffirm intentional, transparent sourcing without mentioning POD or vendor names (e.g., "stitched in small batches in the United States to honor the maker's pace").

**Tone**: Warm, unhurried, boutique. Avoid "In Stock / Out of Stock" and any POD terminology. Replace with Kanbulo-approved phrases like "Created with intention" or "Thoughtfully made."
