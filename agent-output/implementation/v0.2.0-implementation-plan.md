# Kanbulo - Final Implementation Plan: Storytelling & Community (v0.2.0)

**Goal**: Transform Kanbulo from a transactional MVP into a brand ecosystem by addressing critical messaging gaps and introducing high-value emotional features (Journal and Gifting).

**Dependencies**: Headless Shopify + Next.js MVP (v0.1.0) is functionally complete.

## Phase 0: Critical Copy Alignment (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Review and implement new foundational copy that perfectly aligns with the Kanbulo Brand Core, reinforcing **Tenderness, Warmth, and Care** immediately upon landing. This fixes the reported compliance/relevance issue.

| Task ID | Description | Output/Deliverable | Estimated Effort | Validation Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1.1 | **Homepage Copy Rewrite** | Rewrite the primary hero section and value proposition blocks using language from the Brand Core (e.g., "Made with tenderness," focusing on "soft fabrics" and "intentional design"). | 1 day | Copy is validated against the Approved Language list and evokes a feeling of warmth, care, and quality (not transaction or urgency). |
| 0.1.2 | **About Us Page Integration** | Implement a dedicated `/about` page featuring the **PURPOSE, VISION, and VALUES** sections. Use the Founder's Elevator Pitch as the core narrative. | 1 day | `/about` page is live; all core brand documents are represented; restricted language is absent. |
| 0.1.3 | **Visual/Copy Audit** | Run a final audit on all MVP pages (Home, PDP, Cart) to ensure copy and photography placeholders work harmoniously to convey the boutique feel. | 0.5 days | No copy feels generic or transactional; messaging reinforces "Why it matters." |

## Phase 1: The Kanbulo Journal (Epic 2.1) - *Uses Headless Shopify*

| Task ID | Description | Output/Deliverable | Estimated Effort | Validation Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.1 | **Shopify CMS Setup (Blog/API)** | Configure Shopify's native Blog feature. Create a "Kanbulo Journal" blog and ensure the Next.js environment can retrieve blog data via the **Shopify Storefront API**. | 0.5 days | Blog created in Shopify admin; Next.js environment confirms successful retrieval of blog data. |
| 1.1.2 | **Frontend Journal Hub (`/journal`)** | Create the main `/journal` index page, fetching content directly from the **Shopify Storefront API**, using the tender UX principles. | 2 days | Index page is aesthetically consistent with the storefront; all content is fetched directly from Shopify. |
| 1.1.3 | **Single Article Page (SAP) Design** | Implement the layout for individual journal articles, ensuring the design beautifully renders the content from the Shopify Blog system. | 1.5 days | SAP renders content from the Shopify API; typography is highly legible; adherence to soft UX is confirmed. |
| 1.1.4 | **Content Ingestion & SEO Setup** | Ingest the first three foundational articles directly into the Shopify Blog admin. Configure Next.js SEO metadata using data fetched from the Shopify API. | 1 day | Three articles are published; SEO tools confirm correct tagging and indexing setup using Shopify source data. |

## Phase 2: The Keepsake Gifting Experience (Epic 2.2)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1.1 | **Gift Message Cart Integration** | Add a simple text input field to the Cart/Review page for a personalized gift message (max 250 characters). Message is saved as a Shopify Cart Attribute. | 1 day | Message successfully captures input and is saved to the cart object. |
| 2.1.2 | **Keepsake Box Product Setup** | Create a non-physical "Signature Kanbulo Keepsake Box" as a $X product in Shopify, visible only in the Cart as an add-on. | 0.5 days | The box option is selectable in the cart and correctly adds a surcharge to the total. |
| 2.1.3 | **Fulfillment Data Flow Update** | Update the existing Printful order flow logic (from v0.1.0) to pass the gift message and the presence of the Keepsake Box to the Printful order **Notes** field. | 1 day | Test order verifies that the gift message and packaging request are clearly visible in the Printful order notes for fulfillment. |
| 2.1.4 | **Post-Purchase Gift Logic** | Implement conditional logic for gift orders: 1) Suppress pricing/invoice details from the physical packing slip. 2) Customize the order confirmation email for gift recipients (no pricing). | 1.5 days | Test purchase confirms pricing is omitted from the packing slip/receipts; gift recipient email template is triggered correctly. |
