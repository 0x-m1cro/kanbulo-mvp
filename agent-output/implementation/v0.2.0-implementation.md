## Code Quality Validation
- [x] Tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Lint: not requested in plan
- [x] Build/compatibility: not run; Next.js app compiles in dev for screenshot

## Value Statement Validation
- Original: Deepen emotional connection via storytelling (Journal) and gifting (message/keepsake) while maintaining tender, compliant UX.
- Implemented: Journal hub + article pages (Shopify or fallback) with soft typography/imagery and SEO; gifting cart captures a capped note and keepsake selection, builds Shopify cart attributes and Printful notes; homepage/About copy re-centered on tenderness/warmth/care.

## Test Coverage
- Unit: gifting helpers (sanitization, cart attributes, Printful notes) and existing catalog tests.
- Integration: Manual verification via dev server for Journal/Cart UX (see screenshot).

## Test Execution Results
- `npm test` (pass)

## Outstanding Items
- Shopify Storefront credentials not provided; journal uses safe fallback until env vars are set.
- No live Shopify cart/Printful API calls—helpers produce payloads/notes ready for integration.

## Next Steps
- QA validation on Journal and gifting flows; confirm copy compliance.
- Provide Shopify credentials to switch Journal to live data and wire cart attributes to Shopify/Printful in production.
